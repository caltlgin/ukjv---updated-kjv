</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The same was in the beginning with God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> In him was life; and the life was the light of men. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the Word (o. logos) was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said they unto him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What say you of yourself? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:26</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom all of you know not; 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:27</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:28</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:29</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The next day John sees Jesus coming unto him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:30</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:31</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:32</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit (o. pneuma) descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:33</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit (o. pneuma) descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Spirit. (o. pneuma) 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:34</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:35</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:36</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God! 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:37</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:38</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and says unto them, What seek all of you? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwell you? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:39</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He says unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:40</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:41</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He first finds his own brother Simon, and says unto him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:42</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:43</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and says unto him, Follow me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:44</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:45</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Philip finds Nathanael, and says unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:46</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip says unto him, Come and see. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:47</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:48</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Nathanael says unto him, Whence know you me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:49</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Nathanael answered and says unto him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:50</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto you, I saw you under the fig tree, believe you? you shall see greater things than these. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">1:51</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he says unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter all of you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:1</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus says unto him, They have no wine. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto her, Woman, what have I to do with you? mine hour is not yet come. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> His mother says unto the servants, Whatsoever he says unto you, do it. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And there were set there six water pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he says unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And says unto him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things behind; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your house has eaten me up. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign show you unto us, seeing that you do these things? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you rear it up in three days? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But he spoke of the temple of his body. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word (o. logos) which Jesus had said. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">2:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:1</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Nicodemus says unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, (o. pneuma) he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit (o. pneuma) is spirit. (o. pneuma) 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Marvel not that I said unto you, All of you must be born again. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The wind (o. pneuma) blows where it decides, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell whence it comes, and where it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. (o. pneuma) 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered and said unto him, Are you a master of Israel, and know not these things? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Verily, verily, I say unto you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and all of you receive not our witness. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> If I have told you earthly things, and all of you believe not, how shall all of you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> That whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And this is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For John was not yet cast into prison. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:26</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bare witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:27</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:28</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> All of you yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:29</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:30</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He must increase, but I must decrease. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:31</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:32</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:33</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:34</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For he whom God has sent speaks the words (o. rhema) of God: for God gives not the Spirit (o. pneuma) by measure unto him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:35</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">3:36</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:1</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he must essentially go through Samaria. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus says unto her, Give me to drink. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy food.) 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then says the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered and said unto her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The woman says unto him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then have you that living water? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Are you greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinks of this water shall thirst again: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The woman says unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come here to draw. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto her, Go, call your husband, and come here. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, You have well said, I have no husband: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband: in that said you truly. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The woman says unto him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and all of you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when all of you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> All of you worship all of you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit (o. pneuma) and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> God is a Spirit: (o. pneuma) and they that worship him must worship him in spirit (o. pneuma) and in truth. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The woman says unto him, I know that Messiah comes, which is called Christ: when he has come, he will tell us all things. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:26</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto her, I that speak unto you am he. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:27</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seek you? or, Why talk you with her? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:28</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and says to the men, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:29</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:30</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:31</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:32</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But he said unto them, I have food to eat that all of you know not of. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:33</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has any man brought him ought to eat? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:34</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:35</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Say not all of you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:36</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit unto life eternal: that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:37</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And herein is that saying (o. logos) true, One sows, and another reaps. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:38</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> I sent you to reap that whereon all of you bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and all of you are entered into their labours. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:39</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying (o. logos) of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:40</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:41</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And many more believed because of his own word; (o. logos) 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:42</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:43</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:44</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honour in his own country. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:45</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:46</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:47</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:48</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said Jesus unto him, Except all of you see signs and wonders, all of you will not believe. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:49</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The nobleman says unto him, Sir, come down before my child die. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:50</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto him, Go your way; your son lives. And the man believed the word (o. logos) that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:51</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Your son lives. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:52</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:53</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Your son lives: and himself believed, and his whole house. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">4:54</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:1</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he says unto him, Will you be made whole? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto him, Rise, take up your bed, and walk. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your bed. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up your bed, and walk. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto you, Take up your bed, and walk? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he that was healed know not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto you. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things whatsoever he does, these also does the Son likewise. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that all of you may marvel. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For as the Father raises up the dead, and replenishes life to them; even so the Son gives life to whom he will. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment unto the Son: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honors not the Son honors not the Father which has sent him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hears my word, (o. logos) and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:26</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself; 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:27</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:28</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:29</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:30</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:31</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:32</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> There is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:33</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> All of you sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:34</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that all of you might be saved. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:35</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He was a burning and a shining light: and all of you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:36</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:37</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. All of you have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:38</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And all of you have not his word (o. logos) abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him all of you believe not. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:39</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Search the scriptures; for in them all of you think all of you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:40</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And all of you will not come to me, that all of you might have life. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:41</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> I receive not honour from men. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:42</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But I know you, that all of you have not the love (o. agape) of God in you. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:43</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> I am come in my Father's name, and all of you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him all of you will receive. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:44</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> How can all of you believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that comes from God only? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:45</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom all of you trust. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:46</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For had all of you believed Moses, all of you would have believed me; for he wrote of me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">5:47</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But if all of you believe not his writings, how shall all of you believe my words? (o. rhema) 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:1</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he says unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says unto him, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> There is a lad here, which has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is truthfully that prophet that should come into the world. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But he says unto them, It is I; be not afraid. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land where they went. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save that one into where his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone; 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> (nevertheless there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:) 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also went on board ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when came you here? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:26</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, All of you seek me, not because all of you saw the miracles, but because all of you did eat of the loaves, and were filled. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:27</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Labour not for the food which perishes, but for that food which endures unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him has God the Father sealed.

</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:29</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that all of you believe on him whom he has sent. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:30</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> They said therefore unto him, What sign show you then, that we may see, and believe you? what do you work? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:31</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:32</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:33</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For the bread of God is he which comes down from heaven, and gives life unto the world.

</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:35</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:36</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But I said unto you, That all of you also have seen me, and believe not. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:37</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:38</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:39</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:40</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:41</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:42</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he says, I came down from heaven? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:43</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.

</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:46</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God, he has seen the Father.

</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:52</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:53</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except all of you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, all of you have no life in you.

</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:59</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:60</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; (o. logos) who can hear it? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:61</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Does this offend you? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:62</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> What and if all of you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:63</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> It is the spirit that gives life; (o. pneuma) the flesh profits nothing: the words (o. rhema) that I speak unto you, they are spirit, (o. pneuma) and they are life. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:64</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:65</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:66</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:67</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will all of you also go away? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:68</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words (o. rhema) of eternal life. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:69</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:70</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">6:71</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:1</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart behind, and go into Judaea, that your disciples also may see the works that you do. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For there is no man that does any thing in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For neither did his brethren believe in him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The world cannot hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Go all of you up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceives the people. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Nevertheless no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law?  Why go all of you about to kill me? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The people answered and said, You have a devil: who goes about to kill you? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and all of you all marvel. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and all of you on the sabbath day circumcise a man. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are all of you angry at me, because I have made a man everything whole on the sabbath day? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:26</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But, lo, he speaks boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:27</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Nevertheless we know this man whence he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows whence he is. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:28</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, All of you both know me, and all of you know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom all of you know not. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:29</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But I know him: for I am from him, and he has sent me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:30</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:31</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ comes, will he do more miracles than these which this man has done? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:32</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:33</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:34</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> All of you shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither all of you cannot come. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:35</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:36</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> What manner of saying (o. logos) is this that he said, All of you shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither all of you cannot come? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:37</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:38</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:39</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> (But this spoke he of the Spirit, (o. pneuma) which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Spirit (o. pneuma) was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:40</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, (o. logos) said, Truthfully this is the Prophet. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:41</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:42</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Has not the scripture said, That Christ comes of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:43</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> So there was a division among the people because of him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:44</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:45</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have all of you not brought him? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:46</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:47</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then answered them the Pharisees, Are all of you also deceived? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:48</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:49</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But this people who knows not the law are cursed. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:50</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Nicodemus says unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:51</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Does our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he does? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:52</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> They answered and said unto him, Are you also of Galilee?  Search, and look: for out of Galilee arises no prophet. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">7:53</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And every man went unto his own house. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:1</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say you? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those your accusers? has no man condemned you? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn you: go, and sin no more. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then spoke Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, You bear record of yourself; your record is not true. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and where I go; but all of you cannot tell whence I come, and where I go. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> All of you judge after the flesh; I judge no man. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me bears witness of me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said they unto him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, All of you neither know me, nor my Father: if all of you had known me, all of you should have known my Father also. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> These words (o. rhema) spoke Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and all of you shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I go, all of you cannot come. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he says, Where I go, all of you cannot come. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he said unto them, All of you are from beneath; I am from above: all of you are of this world; I am not of this world. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> I said therefore unto you, that all of you shall die in your sins: for if all of you believe not that I am he, all of you shall die in your sins. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">8:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said they unto him, Who are you? And Jesus says unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.

</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then after that says he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone you; and go you thither again? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> These things said he: and after that he says unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Nevertheless Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent all of you may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But I know, that even now, whatsoever you will ask of God, God will give it you. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto her, Your brother shall rise again. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Martha says unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:26</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And whosoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you this? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:27</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> She says unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:28</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master has come, and calls for you. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:29</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:30</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:31</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goes unto the grave to weep there. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:32</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:33</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, (o. pneuma) and was troubled. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:34</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And said, Where have all of you laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:35</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus wept. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:36</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:37</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:38</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:39</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus said, Take all of you away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, says unto him, Lord, by this time he stinks: for he has been dead four days. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:40</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto her, Said I not unto you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:41</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:42</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And I knew that you hear me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that you have sent me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:43</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:44</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes: and his face was bound about with a cloth. Jesus says unto them, Loose him, and let him go. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:45</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:46</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:47</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many miracles. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:48</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:49</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, All of you know nothing at all, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:50</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:51</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And this spoke he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:52</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:53</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then from that day forth they took counsel together in order to put him to death. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:54</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:55</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:56</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then sought they for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think all of you, that he will not come to the feast? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">11:57</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show it, that they might take him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:1</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then says one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying has she kept this. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For the poor always all of you have with you; but me all of you have not always. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, your King comes, sitting on an ass's colt. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive all of you how all of you prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of man should be glorified. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:26</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:27</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:28</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:29</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:30</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:31</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:32</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:33</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> This he said, signifying what death he should die. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:34</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abides for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:35</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while all of you have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:36</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> While all of you have light, believe in the light, that all of you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:37</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:38</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> That the saying (o. logos) of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:39</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Therefore they could not believe, because that Isaiah said again, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:40</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:41</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:42</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:43</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:44</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:45</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he that sees me sees him that sent me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:46</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believes on me should not abide in darkness. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:47</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And if any man hear my words, (o. rhema) and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:48</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He that rejects me, and receives not my words, (o. rhema) has one that judges him: the word (o. logos) that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:49</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">12:50</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:1</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He rises from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> After that he pours water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then comes he to Simon Peter: and Peter says unto him, Lord, do you wash my feet? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Peter says unto him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Simon Peter says unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says to him, He that is washed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean everything: and all of you are clean, but not all. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, All of you are not all clean. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know all of you what I have done to you? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> All of you call me Master and Lord: and all of you say well; for so I am. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">13:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; all of you also ought to wash one another's feet.

</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore all of you seek me, let these go their way:

</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spoke unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then says the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Are not you also one of this man's disciples? He says, I am not. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Why ask you me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answer you the high priest so? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smite you me? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:26</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did not I see you in the garden with him? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:27</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:28</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:29</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring all of you against this man? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:30</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> They answered and said unto him, If he were not a villain, we would not have delivered him up unto you. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:31</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said Pilate unto them, Take all of you him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:32</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> That the saying (o. logos) of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:33</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Are you the King of the Jews? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:34</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered him, Say you this thing of yourself, or did others tell it you of me? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:35</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you unto me: what have you done? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:36</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from behind. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:37</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Pilate therefore said unto him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:38</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Pilate says unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and says unto them, I find in him no fault at all. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:39</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But all of you have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will all of you therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">18:40</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:1</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the soldiers intertwined a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they stroke him with their hands. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Pilate therefore went forth again, and says unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that all of you may know that I find no fault in him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate says unto them, Behold the man! 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate says unto them, Take all of you him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, (o. logos) he was the more afraid; 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And went again into the judgment hall, and says unto Jesus, Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then says Pilate unto him, Speak you not unto me? know you not that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me unto you has the greater sin. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whosoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, (o. logos) he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he says unto the Jews, Behold your King! 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate says unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Pilate answered, What I have written I have written. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:26</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he says unto his mother, Woman, behold your son! 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:27</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then says he to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:28</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:29</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:30</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the spirit. (o. pneuma) 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:31</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:32</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:33</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:34</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:35</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knows that he says true, that all of you might believe. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:36</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:37</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:38</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:39</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:40</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:41</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb, wherein was never man yet laid. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">19:42</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the tomb was nigh at hand. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:1</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The first day of the week comes Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and sees the stone taken away from the tomb. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and says unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the tomb. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the tomb. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then comes Simon Peter following him, and went into the tomb, and sees the linen clothes lie, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the cloth, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But Mary stood without at the tomb weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the tomb, 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And they say unto her, Woman, why weep you? She says unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you?  She, supposing him to be the gardener, says unto him, Sir, if you have borne him behind, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and says unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and says unto them, Peace be unto you. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and says unto them, Receive all of you the Holy Spirit: (o. pneuma) 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Whomsoever sins all of you remit, they are remitted unto them; and whomsoever sins all of you retain, they are retained. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:26</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:27</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then says he to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:28</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:29</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:30</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">20:31</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But these are written, that all of you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing all of you might have life through his name. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:1</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and likewise showed he himself. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:2</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:3</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Simon Peter says unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with you. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:4</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:5</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then Jesus says unto them, Children, have all of you any food? They answered him, No. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:6</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and all of you shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:7</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved says unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:8</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:9</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:10</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto them, Bring of the fish which all of you have now caught. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:11</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:12</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:13</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:14</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:15</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> So when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these? He says unto him, Yea, Lord; you know that I love you. He says unto him, Feed my lambs. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:16</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He says to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He says unto him, Yea, Lord; you know that I love you. He says unto him, Feed my sheep. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:17</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> He says unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Love you me? And he said unto him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus says unto him, Feed my sheep. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:18</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Verily, verily, I say unto you, When you were young, you gird yourself, and walked where you would: but when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you where you would not. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:19</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he says unto him, Follow me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:20</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays you? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:21</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Peter seeing him says to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:22</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Jesus says unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you? follow you me. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:23</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> Then went this saying (o. logos) abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you? 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:24</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true. 
</FONT></P><P><SUP><FONT COLOR="#666699">21:25</FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#333333"> And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
